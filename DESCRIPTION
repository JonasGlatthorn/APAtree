Title: Calculate the 'Area Potentially Available' (APA) to Trees via Rasterized 'Weighted Voronoi Diagrams'
Version: 1.0.0

Maintainer: Jonas Glatthorn <jonas.glatthorn@posteo.de>
Description: The `area potentially available` of trees is calculated from
  mapped forest stands. This is done by computing a rasterized version of
  'Weighted Voronoi Diagrams' using a an approximation of the trees competitive
  ability (e.g., crown radius, leaf area) as weight. The main output are Raster*
  objects from the raster package that are stored together with the raw data in
  apa_list's, the main class of the APAtree package. Aggregation functions are
  provided to calculate the most important stand characteristics based on APA-maps.
